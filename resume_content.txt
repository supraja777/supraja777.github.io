WORK EXPERIENCE 
Application Developer | ThoughtWorks | Hyderabad                                                                            Jan 2024 - Jul 2025 
 Engineered bill notifications and alerts within the distributed autopay platform using Spring Boot and Java, leveraging 
software design patterns to build reliable, modular components, and boosting customer experience by 30% through 
consistent payment reminders. 
 Architected a robust recurring mandate protocol for autopay, confirming instantaneous payments after bill production, 
thereby maximizing payment efficiency and diminishing payment failure rates by 1.5%. 
 Decreased payment processing latency by 75ms by optimizing BBPS APIs; accelerated bill and biller data retrieval, 
enhancing performance, scalability, and customer satisfaction in real-time transactions. 
 Implemented Redis Pub/Sub architecture, increasing concurrent processing capabilities by at least 25%, decreasing 
execution latency for high-demand distributed workflows, and improving overall system responsiveness. 
 Reduced time spent on PostgreSQL maintenance by automating database updates, improving data integrity across 
systems, and ensuring consistent uptime, while optimizing database performance by 10%.
