🚀 AI Portfolio Architect
An intelligent system designed to transform a standard PDF resume into a high-end, professional portfolio website in under a minute. By leveraging Llama 3.3 and Streamlit, this tool automates the journey from a static document to a live, production-ready web presence.

🌟 Overview
The AI Portfolio Architect removes the manual effort of web development. It doesn't just copy text; it re-architects your professional story. Using advanced LLM logic, it categorizes your expertise, rewrites your achievements using the impact-driven X-Y-Z formula, and injects it into a sophisticated, responsive UI.

The Admin Control Center
The intuitive upload interface allows for seamless file processing and provides real-time feedback during the AI generation and GitHub deployment phases.
